# Firmware files (gitignored)

This folder is intentionally gitignored so you can drop coordinator firmware files here without committing them.

Default file used by the helper scripts:

- `./firmware/coordinator.hex`

The `firmware flash` helper (see `/home/wass/raspi/env.sh`) currently downloads Koenkk’s Z-Stack coordinator firmware:

- `Z-Stack_3.x.0_coordinator_20250321` (published 2025-07-10)
