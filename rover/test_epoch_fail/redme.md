# not time series plotter
* as of version 0.8.4, the plot did not took the timestamp in consideration, rather was drawing points one after the other.
* assumption by this epoch-charting library is that all samples are captured within the same time delta, which does not make of any any time series plotting, rather a simple table plotting
* if this feature is not added, this is limit a scam library which is a pity given all nice features and fluent rendering
