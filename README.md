# Safety warning
* Power Sockets have deadly voltage and should not be self altered
* Usage of certified products such as Shelly or others is recommended for any high voltage product
* hacking custom scripts to control equipment might improve safety in case you add power cut off to a lower power for each section and device, but might also alter your food if your fridge inadvertantly goes off due to a wrong configuration
  * reboot state
  * safety power too low
* Any heat power control custom script must necessarily have another safe switch to fully cut the power when away or device is inattended.
